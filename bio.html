            Hello! I'm Adam Kercheval. I'm a junior at Tufts University,
            double-majoring in Spanish and Computer Science. I'm super
            into design, aesthetics, typography, and UI. Those aren't
            the only things I do, though - if you're curious, I'm fascinated
            by English grammar and syntax, jazz music, Latin American
            literature, coffee (that's a big one), Family Feud... the list goes on.
        </p>
        <p>
            I grew up in central New Jersey, and I now split my time between
            Boston and Boulder, Colorado, which are both beautiful places,
            though one is markedly colder than the other.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nowadays, you can find me at Tufts, either in Halligan or in Olin,
            or I could also be taking one of my famous 12-minute naps.
