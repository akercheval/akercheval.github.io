        <h1>A little bit about me</h1>
        <p>
            Hello! I'm Adam Kercheval. I'm a junior at Tufts University,
            double-majoring in Spanish and Computer Science. I'm super
            into design, aesthetics, typography, and UI. Those aren't
            the only things I do, though - if you're curious, I'm fascinated
            by English grammar and syntax, jazz music, Latin American
            literature, coffee (that's a big one), the list goes on.
        </p>
        <p>
            I grew up in central New Jersey, and I now split my time between
            Boston and Boulder, Colorado, which are both beautiful places,
            though one is markedly colder than the other.
        </p>
        <p>
            I love puns and wordplay, taking 12-minute naps, coffee (did I
            mention that yet?), that rush you get when the machine at CVS
            prints out coupons, and trying to convince people that muffins
            are to cupcakes as doughnuts are to bagels.
